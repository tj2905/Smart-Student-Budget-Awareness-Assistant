**0:00 - 0:30 | The Hook**
"Meet Rahul. Rahul is a second-year student who just realized they spent their whole monthly allowance in two weeks. This is a common story on campus. Today, we introduce StudentSpend AI—the companion Rahul needs to stay on track."

**0:30 - 1:15 | Core Workflow**
"Logging an expense is fast. Let’s add a ₹2000 textbook purchase. Instantly, our progress bar updates. If we go over our ₹15,000 budget, the bar turns red. No complicated menus—just a clear view of where every rupee goes."

**1:15 - 2:00 | The 'Smart' Factor**
"Data entry is one thing, but understanding it is another. By clicking 'Generate Insights', we send Rahul's data to Google Gemini. Notice how it identifies that Rahul spends mostly on 'Transport' on weekends? It then suggests using a student pass to save ₹500 next month. That’s real-world mentorship."

**2:00 - 2:45 | Visualization & Privacy**
"Our charts give a bird's-eye view of monthly habits. Everything you see is stored locally on the student's device. No cloud, no tracking. And for those who love spreadsheets, one click exports the entire history to CSV."

**2:45 - 3:00 | Conclusion**
"StudentSpend AI isn't just an app; it's a financial education tool. Built with React and Gemini, it's ready to help students across India master their money."
